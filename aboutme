# Config-Driven Python ETL Pipeline

## Problem Statement
This project simulates a production-style ETL pipeline where business logic
is driven by configuration instead of hardcoded transformations.

## Architecture Overview
Source data is ingested from flat files, validated, transformed using
config-driven rules, and prepared for downstream analytics.

## Design Decisions
- Python chosen for readability and ecosystem
- Config-driven logic to avoid hardcoding
- Early validation to prevent bad data propagation

## Failure Scenarios Handled
- Missing or invalid fields
- Data type mismatches
- Unexpected schema changes

## Cost & Scalability Considerations
- Lightweight batch processing
- Simple design to minimize operational overhead

## Future Improvements
- Add orchestration (Airflow)
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Move storage to cloud object store
